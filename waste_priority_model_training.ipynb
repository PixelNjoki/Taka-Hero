    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook builds a multi-modal AI system that:\n",
    "1. Classifies waste images (hazardous, medical, plastic, organic, etc.)\n",
    "2. Analyzes text descriptions for urgency indicators\n",
    "3. Assigns priority levels: **Critical (Red)**, **Urgent (Orange)**, **Important (Black)**, **Secondary (Blue)**\n",
    "4. Generates solution suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Priority Classification Logic\n",
    "- **Critical (Red)**: Hazardous waste, medical waste, toxic materials, immediate health risks\n",
    "- **Urgent (Orange)**: Large illegal dumps, blocked waterways, accumulating waste in public areas\n",
    "- **Important (Black)**: Public space littering, recyclable accumulation, infrastructure concerns\n",
    "- **Secondary (Blue)**: Minor littering, maintenance issues, single-item reports"

    "### What This Notebook Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Modal Input Processing**:\n",
    "   - Image analysis using EfficientNet (pretrained on ImageNet)\n",
    "   - Text analysis using DistilBERT\n",
    "   - Combined feature fusion for priority classification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Priority Classification**:\n",
    "   - **Critical (Red)**: Hazardous, medical, toxic waste requiring immediate action\n",
    "   - **Urgent (Orange)**: Large dumps, blockages, environmental threats\n",
    "   - **Important (Black)**: Public space waste, recyclables\n",
    "   - **Secondary (Blue)**: Minor littering, single items\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solution Generation**:\n",
    "   - Context-aware suggestions based on waste type and priority\n",
    "   - Specific actions for different scenarios\n",
    "   - Integration with local resources\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Automatic Status Management**:\n",
    "   - New reports → Analyzed by model\n",
    "   - Priority assigned → Status: \"Pending\"\n",
    "   - Action taken → Status: \"In Progress\"\n",
    "   - Resolved → Removed from active list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train the model on real waste images (download dataset as indicated)\n",
    "2. Fine-tune on Kenya-specific waste patterns\n",
    "3. Integrate with Flask app using the provided predictor class\n",
    "4. Deploy and monitor performance\n",
    "5. Continuously improve with real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files Generated:\n",
    "- `waste_priority_model.pth`: Trained PyTorch model\n",
    "- `model_config.json`: Model configuration\n",
    "- `solution_generator.pkl`: Solution generation system\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready for integration into Taka-Hero app! 🚀"
